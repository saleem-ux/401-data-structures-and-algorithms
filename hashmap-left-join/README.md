## Approach

* ### I understood the problem first
* ### I imagined how the results should be
* ### I made a drawings of how the hashTable would be after insertion of multiple key and values.
* ### I wrote the code
* ### I made the tests

## Efficiency

* ### time : O(n) 
* ### space : O(n) 


## API

* ### Hashtable

  - leftJoin(leftHash, rightHash)  : This method LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.
